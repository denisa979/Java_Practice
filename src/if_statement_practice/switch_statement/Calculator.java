Create a class called Calculator, Given two double variables named n1 & n2, and a char variable named mathOperator, write a program that can calculate result of n1&n2 based on the given math Operator.

        char operator -> -, +, , /

        when operator is + : add num1, num2
        when operator: - : minus num1, num2
        when operator: : multiply num1, num2
        when operator: / : divide num1, num2
        for any other operators: print "invalid operator"

        Ex:
            n1 = 10, n2= 20, mathOperator = '+'

        output:
            30

        Note: MUST use switch statement

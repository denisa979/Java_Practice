/*
HTTP is the protocol that governs communications between web-servers and web clients.
Part of the protocol includes a status code returned by the server to tell the browser the status of its most recent page request.
    Some of the codes and their meanings are listed below:

            status codes and their meanings:
                    200, OK
                    201, Created
                    202, Accepted
                    301, Moved Permanently
                    303, See Other
                    304, Not Modified
                    307, Temporary Redirect
                    400, Bad Request
                    401, Unauthorized
                    403, Forbidden
                    404, Not Found
                    410, Gone
                    500, Internal Server Error
                    503, Service Unavailable


         declare an int variable called statusCode, and a valid status code is already given
         write a program that prints out, on a line by itself, the appropriate label from the above list based on status.

                    Example:
                        if status code = 200

                    output:
                        ok

           Note: MUST use switch statement
